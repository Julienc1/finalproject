Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
Option 2
IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
One of the classes I will define will be Class "Movie."


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
The Movie Class will take in a dictionary representing a single movie.


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
One instance of this class will represent a single movie that is on the OMDB database.


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
Three instance variables this class will have are "title", "director", and "languages". "Title" will hold the name of the movie, "director" will 
hold the name of the person that directed the movie, and "languages" will be the count of the number of languages the movie is in. These instance
variables are important becasue they will hold information for each instance of class "Movie" and will help me gather information to fill my tables and database later on.


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
get_info

- What will the method do?
The method will give a text description of the movie plot.

- Will it take any additional input? 
It will only take in the movie dictionary as input.

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
The method will return a description for the particular movie in a string format. It will not change an nstance variable.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It will be useful to add to my database, and possibly to connect with Twitter in some way. I could perhaps do searches on the Twitter API related
to what each movie is about.


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
increaseRating

- What will the method do?
If the rating is less than 10, the user can improve the imdb rating by any amount with this method if they feel the movie deserves better than what it has.

- Will it take any additional input? 
Yes, it will take in the movie dictionary and the integer amount the user wants to increase the score by.

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return the updated score for the movie. It will change the "rating" instance variable to reflect the new score.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It is useful to allow the programmer to possibly classify the movies they choose by how much they liked the movie.

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
Tweets, Users, and Movies


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
-tweet_id (primary key)
-tweet_text
-user_id
-movie_id
-num_favorites
-num_retweets

Users:
-user_id (primary key)
-screen_name
-num_favourites
-description

Movies:
-movie_id (primary key)
-movie_title
-director
-languages
-rating
-top_actor
-rated
-released




* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")
1. I am going to make a query to my Movies database hat accesses how many movies in my database have a rating of "PG-13".

2. I will also make a query to access the release date of the movie and the tweet text where the particular movie was referenced. I will be joining, therefore, the Tweets and Movies tables.



* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
Set comprehension, the Counter from the collections library, and the filer function.



* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
1. Set comprehension: This will be useful for creating lists of Tweet and Movie instances from the classes I have created. It will alos be useful for looking for keywords in movie descriptions.

2. Counter: The counter will be useful for finding the most common word in tweets possibly describing a movie or to find the most commonly referenced movie.

3.Filter: The filter function will be useful in finding certain instances of the Movie and Tweet classes based on any sort of parameter given to the filter. For instance I can find all Tweets where the number of favorites exceeds 10.



* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
My output will be in a text file and contain information about the movies I have chosen, what I have learned from looking up these movie titles on Twitter, and small summaries of takeaways from each movie. I will seperate each movie and its information by a few lines in the text file to keep things neat. I can also include information from the movie and tweet dictionaries that will accumulate and from after I use the counter and comprehension tools.
